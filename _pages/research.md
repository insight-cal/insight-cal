# Research

We are interested in all aspects of computer architecture with a special focus on performance, reliability, and security of heterogeneous architectures and accelerators. We aim to generate
insights for architecting future computers that are more energy-efficient, capable, reliable, 
and secure. For more details, please refer to [Prof Jog's website](https://adwaitjog.github.io/).
